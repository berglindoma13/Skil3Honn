/*
Using a REST API the user can view and update his/her profile. In addition to the information provided in the signup, the following information can be added and modified:
    Favorite videos
    List of close friends (i.e. IDs of other users)

These fields are optional, that is, the user does not have to fill them out but if they are filled out they need to be consistent.
Note that the user has to be authenticated for this to work and all the profile information needs to be persisted in the relational database.
At least the following 4 test cases using the REST API need to be constructed:
    View the profile of a user and confirm it correctly matches the expected profile
    Add favorite videos to a user, read the profile back and confirm the list matches
    Update the username of a user, read the profile and confirm it changed
    Add a list of close friends to a profile and read it back to confirm it was stored properly
