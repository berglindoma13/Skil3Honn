/*
Using a REST API the user can access the video service once authenticated. The data by the video service needs to be persisted in the relational database. The supported operations include the following:
    List all videos
    List all videos in a given channel
    Add a video to a channel
    Remove a video

At least the following 3 test cases using the REST API need to be constructed:
    Add a video to a channel and confirm it’s listed in “all videos”
    Add a video to a channel and confirm it’s listed in that channel
    Remove a video and confirm it’s not listed in all videos or the (previous) channel list
